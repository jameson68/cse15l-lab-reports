## Remotely Connecting
* For the part of remotely connecting, what I did is that I tried to use the command of 
```
# input command
ssh cs15lsp23ng@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
, but somehow it showed 
```
# output command
Permission denied
```
so I used the command of 
```
# input command
ssh yiz110@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
which is my email, then it should that I could connect remotely.

* Then when I connect to remote, it showed me how what server am I in and how many people are in the server.

* Tried to use the command of ls -lat for the command

* Also I tried to logout from the remote server, and I tried the command of ls -lat, and found out that it will actually show my my file on my laptop instead of the lab server.
