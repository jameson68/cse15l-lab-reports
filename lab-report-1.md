## Remotely Connecting
* For the part of remotely connecting, what I did is that I tried to use the command of 
```
# input command
ssh cs15lsp23ng@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
, but somehow it showed 
```
# output command
Permission denied
```
so I used the command of 
```
# input command
ssh yiz110@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
which is my email, then I could connect remotely by entering my password.

* Then when I connect to remote, it showed me how what server am I in and how many people are in the server.
