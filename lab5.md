a. What enviroment are you using(computer, operating system, web brower, terminal/editor, and so on)?

Mac, vscode, and using terminal.

b. Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.
